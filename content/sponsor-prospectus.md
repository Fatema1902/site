A new unconference, open space specifically for Open Source Software maintainers. Unlike most conferences, this one will not have any talks. We believe a discussion based conference will have the most benefit to attendees.

We are offering the following sponsorship model which is modeled after that of DevOpsDays:

| Level              | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Host (venue)       | If a company sponsors the venue/food they will be acknowledged as a Host sponsor. Their logo will be directly visible on the main event page, tee-shirts, banners, and badge. |
| Fun (party)        | If a company sponsors a party for the conference they can have their logo on the website, tee-shirts, banners, badges, and everything related to the party itself.            |
| Platinum ($10,000) | 6 included tickets + logo on the website, tee-shirts, banners, and badge.                                                                                                     |
| Gold ($7,000)      | 4 included tickets + logo on the website, tee-shirts, banners, and badge.                                                                                                     |
| Silver ($5,000)    | 2 included tickets + logo on the website, tee-shirts, banners, and badge.                                                                                                     |
| Bronze ($3,000)    | Logo on the website, tee-shirts, banners, and badge.                                                                                                                          |

We are not doing booths because the nature of this event should be the attendee’s not the companies involved. Hopefully the maintainers you send from your company will gain insight into making their daily lives easier which is more valuable than any booth.

Additional à la carte sponsorships are available for lanyard, happy hour, coffee, snacks, and meals and may be purchased in lieu of, or in addition to, the sponsorships above.

If interested in sponsoring please email [organizers@maintainerati.org](mailto:organizers@maintainerati.org).

To get an idea how many people might be interested in this new conference we set up a landing page on https://maintainerati.org and got over 200 submissions over night. In the form we asked (optionally) for people to jot down some ideas on what they wanted to gain from the event. The responses are amazing. Here are some:

> Linux kernel maintainer here, this sounds awesome. topics that I'd like to discuss or learn about:

-	maintainers don't scale, how to fix it: tooling, automation, processes, scaling out, both what works and what's just utter disaster
-	people issues: how to handle assholes, oversized egos, bikeshedding tournaments, burned out maintainer, I-can't-let-go-of-control issues in growing projects and all the other fun stuff
-	scaling out and empowering contributors, without it all crashing down and burning because it's free for all and hey maintainer will catch so I don't have to be careful. various decision processes (committee, benevolent dictator, rough consus, advice process, chaos).

-	how to communicate in issues/PRs when there is an obvious language barrier (a user has difficulty understanding English/French/Chinese/etc)

-	how to say "no" to feature proposals/PRs without hurting people

-	how to moderate discussion on issues

-	how to manage expectations of the users of the project you maintain

-	how to take a "vacation" from maintenance without all users freaking out :(

-	how to gain + onboard new contributors

-	internationalization of the project you maintain

-	how to enforce code/documentation/test standards

-	how to quit being a maintainer without harming your reputation
