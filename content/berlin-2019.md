The first Maintainerati of 2019 is coming to Berlin on 22 May, organized by the new Maintainerati Core Team in collaboration with GitHub. The next edition builds on past events, and aims to provide an open space for the community of maintainers in Western Europe to gather, present, and discuss the unique and pressing challenges they see in a face-to-face setting.

Maintainerati is open to all, whether you are the leader of a popular open source project, or working alone: weâ€™re all in this together. Join us and share your story, tell us about the challenges you face, and help us build a more vibrant, inclusive, and thriving open source community together.
