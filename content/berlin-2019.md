Organized by the new Maintainerati Core Team in collaboration with [GitHub](https://github.com), this next edition builds on past events, and aims to provide an open space for the community of maintainers in Western Europe to gather, present, and discuss the unique and pressing challenges they see in a face-to-face setting.

## Why come?

Come because you care about open source software, your community, and the people who depend upon the software you maintain. Share the challenges you face, the problems you've overcome, the best practices you've learned. Listen to the stories of others, and make your community better.

Maintainerati is open to all maintainers, whether you are the leader of a popular open source project, or working alone: weâ€™re all in this together. Join us and share your story and help us build a more vibrant, inclusive, and thriving open source community together.

## What is an Open Space unconference?

We invite you to participate in Maintainerati, because you have something to contribute. Open Spaces allow us to focus on what's important to you, the attendees, and provides a structure for you and your fellow attendees to drive the agenda.

No speakers, no talks, no passive listening. An Open Space unconference allows you to participate as you want. You set the topics, you drive the conversation, you take away what you need to take away. Have something to share? Share it! Feeling inspired? Act on it! Not interested in the conversation? Move to another one, or start a new one of your own!
