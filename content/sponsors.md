Reach open source maintainers across the globe, and show your support for open source software. Sponsor Maintainerati.

Put simply: Running Maintainerati events, and preparing Field Reports costs money. We need your help. Have a look at the opportunities below, and email <a href="mailto:info@maintainerati.org">info@maintainerati.org</a> if you have any questions, or you think your organization would be interested in sponsoring.

## Berlin 2019 Field Report

We're working on the final draft of the Berlin 2019 Field Report. Full of in-depth analysis and insights into the challenges that maintainers face in Europe and worldwide, we will be releasing this first-ever report at the end of October.

But we need your help. Get your logo and more in the report, and reach maintainers across the globe.
