      <description>This is some text The first Maintainerati of 2019 is coming to Berlin on 22 May, organized by the new Maintainerati Core Team in collaboration with GitHub. The next edition builds on past events, and aims to provide an open space for the community of maintainers in Western Europe to gather, present, and discuss the unique and pressing challenges they see in a face-to-face setting.
Maintainerati is open to all, whether you are the leader of a popular open source project, or working alone: we’re all in this together.</description>

      <description>Maintainerati is a one-day Open Space unconference for open source maintainers.
February 2017 saw a group of open source maintainers gathered at GitHub’s HQ in San Francisco, an event then repeated in London and Amsterdam. Maintainers left these events feeling both inspired and empowered.
During these events, one important thing we learned is that maintainers need to have access to others who are sharing the same experiences, struggles and successes they have while running an open source project.</description>

      <description>(Adapted from the Open Source Feels Diversity Statement)
Platitudes are cheap. We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard conferences and communities say they&amp;rsquo;re committed to &amp;ldquo;diversity&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tolerance&amp;rdquo; without ever getting specific, so here&amp;rsquo;s our stance on it:
We welcome you.
We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification. We welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, dilettantes, musicians, photographers, readers, writers, ordinary people, extraordinary people, and everyone in between.</description>
