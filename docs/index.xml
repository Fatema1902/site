      <description>Maintainerati events are pretty exciting. They’re a rare chance for leaders of all kinds of OSS projects to come together and discuss the many, many challenges they face running their communities.
The pain of conflict, the joy of collaboration, and the sheer difficulties of getting—and retaining—enough hands on deck are just some of the topics mulled over at Maintaineratis.
At the end of the day, attendees leave feeling full of ideas, with renewed enthusiasm for their work, and happy to be supported by their community.</description>

      <description>Maintainerati is a one-day Open Space unconference for open source maintainers.
February 2017 saw a group of open source maintainers gathered at GitHub’s HQ in San Francisco, an event then repeated in London and Amsterdam. Maintainers left these events feeling both inspired and empowered.
During these events, one important thing we learned is that maintainers need to have access to others who are sharing the same experiences, struggles and successes they have while running an open source project.</description>

      <title>Diversity Statement</title>

      <description>(Adapted from the Open Source Feels Diversity Statement)
Platitudes are cheap. We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard conferences and communities say they&amp;rsquo;re committed to &amp;ldquo;diversity&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tolerance&amp;rdquo; without ever getting specific, so here&amp;rsquo;s our stance on it:
We welcome you.
We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification. We welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, dilettantes, musicians, photographers, readers, writers, ordinary people, extraordinary people, and everyone in between.</description>
