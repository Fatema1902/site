      <description>(Adapted from the Open Source Feels Diversity Statement)
Platitudes are cheap. We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard conferences and communities say they&amp;rsquo;re committed to &amp;ldquo;diversity&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tolerance&amp;rdquo; without ever getting specific, so here&amp;rsquo;s our stance on it:
We welcome you.
We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification. We welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, dilettantes, musicians, photographers, readers, writers, ordinary people, extraordinary people, and everyone in between.</description>

      <description>A new unconference, open space specifically for Open Source Software maintainers. Unlike most conferences, this one will not have any talks. We believe a discussion based conference will have the most benefit to attendees.
We are offering the following sponsorship model which is modeled after that of DevOpsDays:
   Level Description     Host (venue) If a company sponsors the venue/food they will be acknowledged as a Host sponsor.</description>
