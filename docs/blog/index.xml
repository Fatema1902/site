      <description>February 2017 saw a group of open source maintainers gathered at GitHubâ€™s HQ in San Francisco, an event then repeated in London and Amsterdam. One left these events feeling both inspired and empowered.
During those events, one important thing we learned is that maintainers need to have access to others who are sharing the same experiences, struggles &amp;amp; successes they have while running an open source project.
In response to this, GitHub has reached out to some very passionate people in the broader maintainers community to help bring some structure and growth to Maintainerati, in the shape of a new core-team to run Maintainerati events and organize the community.</description>
